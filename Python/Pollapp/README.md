## [Pollapp](https://github.com/Antonekk/Cs50-Final-Project)
This was the first bigger programming project that I completed back in 2022 (before university). It was the final part of Harvard's free computer science courese [Cs50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript), which served as a catalyst for launching my journey into the world of computer science.
